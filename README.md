# Weather Application

A weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses geolocation and the Open Weather Map API to show the current weather in a user's area. There is also an option to search other locations in the United States and abroad (using city name, country code). A user may also view the 10-day forecast for a particular location.
